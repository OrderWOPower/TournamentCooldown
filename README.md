# TournamentCooldown
In the vanilla game, there was no cooldown for spawning tournaments after a tournament in a settlement was finished.

This meant that another tournament could spawn in a settlement immediately after the previous tournament.

This is a very simple mod that adds a 10 day cooldown for spawning another tournament in the same settlement.

It is safe to install and uninstall on an existing save.
